    "text": "Description\nIn this R-focused workshop, we will discuss ways to improve your data science workflows! During the course, we will review packages for data validation, alerting, modeling, and more. We’ll use Posit’s open source and professional tools to string all the pieces together for an efficient workflow. We’ll discuss environments, managing deployed content, working with databases, and interoperability across data products.\n\n\nAudience\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nBuild finished data products starting from raw data and are looking to improve your workflow\nAre looking to expand your knowledge of Posit open source and professional tools\nWant to improve interoperability between data products in your work or on your team\nHave experience developing in R. An analogous course with a Python focus is also offered.\n\n\n\nInstructor(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Johnson is a Data Science Advisor at Posit with a background in Microbiology and Bioinformatics. He obtained his PhD from the Uniformed Services University in Maryland and did his postdoctoral training at the National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH. The only thing that rivals his love for infectious diseases is generating ‘super cool’ visualizations from large data sets using R and RStudio. In his free time, you can find Ryan running marathons/ultramarathons in the DC area or hiking miles along the Appalachian Trail. Ryan resides in Gaithersburg with his wife and two feline co-workers.\n\n\n\n\nKatie Masiello is a Solutions Engineer at Posit. A mechanical engineer by training, she found her calling in data science while working statistical analysis in the aerospace industry. A good cup of coffee, reproducibility, and making life easier for the next user are three things she loves most. Katie is an avid knitter and knitr, and she can often be found trying to tame her ridiculously overgrown garden, collecting pebbles, or thinking about taking up running as a hobby."

If you’ve used Quarto to produce a document, you’ve already got the technical skills to create a Quarto website. In this workshop, you’ll learn everything else you need to build a website and customize its appearance.\nYou’ll get a running start by using a template we’ve designed to be functional and attractive, but also act as a guide for your learning. Then you’ll:\n\nAdd pages and navigation, and learn best practices for structuring your content.\nCustomize the visual appearance of your site by mastering the basics of SCSS and CSS and how they apply to Quarto websites.\nUse listings, a special kind of page, to showcase related content like blog posts, projects, or talks.\n\nBy the end of the workshop you’ll have built and published (if you want) a personal website, but the same tools and techniques will apply to any kind of website you might like to build.\nWe’ll assume you’ve used Quarto to produce documents, but we won’t assume you have any HTML, CSS/SCSS or Git/GitHub experience, nor will we assume any particular programming language (R, Python etc.) or level of programming experience.\n\n\nAudience\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nHave used Quarto to generate documents (e.g. HTML, PDF, MS Word etc.)\nAre comfortable editing plain text documents (e.g .qmd) in your IDE (e.g. RStudio, Visual Studio Code etc.)\nWant to walk away with your own personal website\n\n\n\nInstructor(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Charlotte Wickham (she/her) is a Developer Educator on the Quarto team at Posit.

You’ll learn tidymodels syntax as well as the process of predictive modeling for tabular data.\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop is for you if you:\n\nare comfortable using tidyverse packages to read data into R, transform and reshape data, and make a variety of graphs, and\nhave had some exposure to basic statistical concepts such as linear models, residuals, etc.\n\nIntermediate or expert familiarity with modeling or machine learning is not required.

Additionally, with intelligent resizing of components, your Quarto Dashboards look great on devices of all sizes. And importantly, you can author Quarto Dashboards without leaving the comfort of your “home” – using any notebook editor (JupyterLab, etc.) or in plain text markdown with any text editor (VS Code, RStudio, Neovim, etc.). This workshop will walk you through building an increasingly complex dashboard using various layout options and and deploy them as static web pages (with no special server required) as well as with a Shiny Server on the backend for enhanced interactivity.\n\n\nAudience\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nlist at least\nthree attributes\nfor your target audience\n\n\n\nInstructor(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel (she/her) is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and Developer Educator at Posit. Mine’s work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of women and under-represented minorities in STEM. Mine works on integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. Mine works on the OpenIntro project, whose mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education. As part of this project she co-authored four open-source introductory statistics textbooks. She is also the creator and maintainer of datasciencebox.org and she teaches the popular Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera. Mine is a Fellow of the ASA and Elected Member of the ISI as well as the winner of the 2021 Robert V. Hogg Award for Excellence in Teaching Introductory Statistics."
